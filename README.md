YOUTUBE LINK FOR PRESENTATION : 

#Abstract

ONLINE FOOD ORDER SYSTEM is a website designed primarily for use in the food delivery
industry. This system will allow hotels and restaurants to increase scope of business by reducing the labor
cost involved. The system also allows to quickly and easily manage an online menu which customers can
browse and use to place orders with just few clicks. Restaurant employees then use these orders through an
easy to navigate graphical interface for efficient processing.

# Introduction

It is known globally that, in todayâ€™s market, it is extremely difficult to start a new small-scale
business and live-through the competition from the well-established and settled owners. In fast paced time
of today, when everyone is squeezed for time, the majority of people are finicky when it comes to placing a
food order. The customers of today are not only attracted because placing an order online is very
convenient but also because they have visibility into the items offered, price and extremely simplified
navigation for the order.
Online ordering system that I am proposing here, greatly simplifies the ordering process for both
the customer and the restaurant. System presents an interactive and up-to-date menu with all available
options in an easy to use manner. Customer can choose one or more items to place an order which will land
in the Cart. Customer can view all the order details in the cart before checking out. At the end, customer
gets order confirmation details. Once the order is placed it is entered in the database and retrieved in pretty
much real time. This allows Restaurant Employees to quickly go through the orders as they are received
and process all orders efficiently and effectively with minimal delays and confusion.

# Motivation

The motivation for designing this application came because my family is involved in the fast food
business and I personally do not like waiting for long in the store or to have to call store to place an order
especially during the peak lunch or dinner hours. Moreover, I value recent learning about the Java and JSP
Programming languages as well as seeing how powerful and dynamic they are when it comes to web
designing and applications. The languages used to build this application are JavaScript, JSP, HTML and
Java at client facing whereas Oracle database at the back-end because I found them to be extremely useful
while working on the technologies.

# Aim of the Software

This software is developed to help computer science students to learn about the Web application
designing using JSP and HTML from their basic capabilities to build a complete working application from scratch. Further, it gives insight about how GUI interacts with server-side language, Java, and finally with
the Oracle database.
